###About:
  The purpose of this application was to **simplify** late night food searches.
  Often, a lot of food related apps have too much information that is irrelevant. All we wanted to check were:
  - Are there any restaurants near me that are open at this hour?
  - Do they deliver?
  - Restaurant rating?
  - Can we call them right away without separate search windows/additional typing?
